I'm truely not a coder in anyway. I just wanted a viewer that would autoscroll pdfs of sheet music for me (made with frescobaldi) at a rate that I could play along with.

I modified the QtQuick PdfMultiPageViewer component and example application. 

To the component I added a function to "flick" the Table element holding the pdf pages.
To the application example I took out the stuff I didn't need and added a slider for the flick rate and go button to make the flick happen, then away it goes.

It works for what I need it to do and someone else asked for it so here it is.

My work was truly minimal and I owe everything to the Qt people. I hope I'm not violating their license by sharing....eeps!
